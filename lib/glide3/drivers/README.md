## 3Dfx driver libraries

When you're using the 3Dfx renderer, you will need the appropriate Glide library for your 3Dfx card.

Pick a folder from the table below and copy `glide3x.dxe` from it to the game folder (next to the EXE).

|  Card             |  Folder  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Voodoo            | `v1`     |
| Voodoo II         | `v2`     |
| Voodoo 3, Banshee | `v3`     |
| Voodoo 4, 5       | `v4`     |
| Voodoo Rush       | `vr`     |

These have been copied from the [DOjs repository](https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS/tree/master/glide3x).
